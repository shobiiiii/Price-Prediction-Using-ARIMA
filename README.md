# Using ARIMA Model to Predict Stock Prices

In this notebook, I use QQQ 15 minutes closing price as input and pre process the data, then I'm training my models using pmdarima package and plotting predicted prices. 
At the end I tweak model parameters using statistical tests.

I also Uploaded the QQQ closing price and required packages to install on your machine before running the notebook.
